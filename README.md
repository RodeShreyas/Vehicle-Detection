# Vehicle-Detection
Vehicle Detection system which will detect objects whether it is Cars or Trucks

# Aim and Objectives

## Aim
To create a real-time video Car or Truck detection system which will detect objects based on whether it is Car or Truck.

## Objectives
➢ The main objective of the project is to create a program which can be either run on Jetson nano or any pc with YOLOv5 installed and start detecting using the camera module on the device.

➢ The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between cars and trucks based on feature-based data.

➢ Using appropriate datasets for recognizing and interpreting data using machine learning.

➢ To show on the optical view finder of the camera module whether objects are Car or Truck.

## Abstract
➢ This project presents a machine learning and data science approach to distinguish between Cars and Trucks.

➢ An object is classified based on whether it is Car or Truck is detected by the live feed from the system’s camera.

➢ We have completed this project on jetson nano which is a very small computational device.

➢ A lot of research is being conducted in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML), where machines are trained to identify various objects from one another. Machine Learning provides various techniques through which various objects can be detected.

➢ One such technique is to use YOLOv5 with Roboflow model, which generates a small size trained model and makes ML integration easier.

➢ In recent years, the ability to automatically classify vehicles has become increasingly important for applications such as traffic management, toll collection, autonomous driving, and smart city planning.

➢ Automatic classification helps traffic authorities monitor the flow of different vehicle types (cars, trucks, etc.). Trucks often move slower and cause more congestion, so real-time data allows dynamic traffic light control, lane management, and rerouting heavy vehicles to optimize road usage.

➢ Modern toll booths use automated systems to charge different rates based on vehicle type. Machine learning models can accurately classify vehicles, ensuring correct toll charges without manual checks, making the process faster and reducing human error.

## Introduction
➢ The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can automatically distinguish between images of cars and trucks. We are going to implement this project with Machine Learning and this project can be even run on jetson nano which we have done.

➢ Image classification tasks like this are a basic but important application of machine learning and computer vision. Such models can be useful in areas like traffic monitoring, automated toll collection, and smart city projects.

➢ Neural networks and machine learning have been used for these tasks and have obtained good results.

➢ Machine learning algorithms have proven to be very useful in pattern recognition and classification, and hence can be used for fire and smoke detection as well.

Key Steps Involved:

1. Data Collection:
Gather a dataset of car and truck images. Public datasets like the Stanford Cars dataset or custom datasets can be used.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Resize images, normalize pixel values, augment data (like rotation, flipping) to improve model generalization.

3. Training:
Train the model on the labeled images and validate it using a separate validation set.

4. Evaluation:
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

5. Deployment (Optional):
Deploy the model as a web app or mobile app for real-world use.
